Follow these steps to get your job board up and running quickly.

## 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Bordful repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomaslau/bordful.git
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd bordful
npm install
```

## 3. Set Up Airtable

Create a new Airtable base for your job board:

- Create a new base in Airtable
- Create a "Jobs" table with the required fields:
  ```typescript
  interface Job {
    title: string;
    company: string;
    description: string;
    location: string;
    type: "full-time" | "part-time" | "contract";
  }
  ```
- Copy your Airtable API key and base ID

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add your Airtable credentials:

```env
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Jobs
```

## 5. Start the Development Server

Run the development server to see your job board in action:

```bash
npm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see your job board.
